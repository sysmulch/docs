## Ten Tips for Research Scholars Aiming for Their First Significant Publication

In 2023, after many years of teaching scientific writing, I was inspired to write a practical guide to focus on a crucial stage of an aspiring researcher's journey: their first significant publication in a scholarly journal. As far as I know, there is no practical guide that looks at scientific writing from this particular angle. I published this guide in the journal *Science Editor*, which is widely read in the scientific publishing community in the United States and elsewhere.

## A Step-by-step Guide to Technology-enhanced Capacity Development

In 2022, I co-authored this chapter in an open access book published by African Minds. My colleagues and I reflected on ten years of organizational work in using educational technology in an international development context. Our goal was to produce a detailed, evidence-informed guide to help other practitioners follow a clear path from concept to implementation to sustainability.

## How to Target a Journal that's Right for Your Research

In 2014, after giving a talk at a USAID conference in Tanzania, I was invited by SciDev.Net to write a practical guide for researchers on how to select a journal for their paper. *SciDev.Net* is a well-known news source in the science and development sector. The article I wrote was one of the most highly read articles on the website for a few weeks after publication.
