# Quick Start for a Router (Sample)

*This was my assignment submission in STC's TechComm Fundamentals Bootcamp, which I completed in 2023.*

I created this sample Quick Start guide for a router that I used in India. This guide is designed to be printed double-sided on A4 size, heavy stock paper with a tri-fold design. The guide can thus be easily packaged with the router. In this sample, the text, design, and layout are client-ready, and the hand drawings are references for a graphic artist.
