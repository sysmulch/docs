## Installing eScriptorium on a Cloud Server (2024)

In March 2024, I set up an instance of an eScriptorium site for my wife, a librarian. eScriptorium is an open source application for handwritten text recognition. I figured out how to install the site on a cloud server by interviewing a project developer to fill in the gaps in my knowledge. In return, I wrote an installation guide and added it to an eScriptorium project wiki.

## Installation guide for Moodle

Moodle is an open source application for developing online learning environments. Moodle has been a big part of my work. A Moodle installation guide is available on moodle.org, but I’m not quite happy with its rough-edged quality. I’ve created my own version both as a documentation exercise and as a reference for future installs.

My installation guide &mdash; compare with <a href="https://docs.moodle.org/405/en/Step-by-step_Installation_Guide_for_Ubuntu" target="_blank">the guide on moodle.org</a>
