# Installing eScriptorium on a Cloud Server (Debian 11) with a Fully Qualified Domain Name

eScriptorium is an open source application for handwritten text recognition (HTR). Since its release in 2018, this application has become popular with library professionals and researchers who work with medieval manuscripts. To learn more about the project, see the official website.

In February 2024, I attempted to install an eScriptorium site on a cloud server for my wife, who is a librarian. I found a few sets of installation instructions, but none of them were aimed at the goal I had in mind: setting up a publicly accessible eScriptorium site, with a Fully Qualified Domain Name, running on a small, cheap cloud server.

I made a start with the UB Mannheim installation instructions. Then, I had an email exchange with Stefan Weil at UB Mannheim, who is a member of the eScriptorium project, to figure out how to add the missing pieces to reach my goal. Thanks to his very helpful guidance, I managed to get an eScriptorium site online.

I have documented my installation process in detail and added it to the UB Mannheim wiki on eScriptorium.

[Here is the installation guide](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/escriptorium/wiki/Installing-eScriptorium-on-a-Cloud-Server-(Debian-11)-with-a-Fully-Qualified-Domain-Name).
