# Other Writing

## The Other and the Pastoral Ideal (2023)
* An essay for a literature course *
{: .fs-5 .fw-400 }

This piece isn't part of my professional work. But it is work in a different sense: a personal quest to understand America as an immigrant-in-waiting. As part of this quest, I took a course on the modern American novel with Oxford University's continuing education department. I read and discussed five novels during the course, and at the end I submitted an essay titled "The Other and the Pastoral Ideal: A Common Thread in Ceremony and American Pastoral."
