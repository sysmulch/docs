## Digital Technology in Capacity Development (2022)
*Chapters in a book*
{: .fs-5 .fw-400 }

In 2022, I worked with my colleagues at INASP to write a book on how digital tools and platforms can be used for capacity development in the Global South. The open access book was published by African Minds, a publisher in South Africa. I co-authored two of the four chapters in the book and several case studies.

##  Welcome Video for Participants in INASP's Facilitated Courses (2023)
*A video for online course participants*
{: .fs-5 .fw-400 }

I wear various hats to support the online learning initiative at INASP, a nonprofit in the U.K. Since 2011, I have been a site administrator, instructional designer, content writer, course developer, course facilitator, and general online learning nerd. I recently collaborated with one of our guest facilitators to record an onboarding video for course participants, many of whom don't have experience using a learning management system.

## A MOOC Approach for Training Researchers in Developing Countries (2017)
*A research article*
{: .fs-5 .fw-400 }

In 2015, I led the introduction of MOOCs at INASP, responding to the surging demand for training on scientific writing from researchers in the Global South. In 2017, after seeing successful outcomes, I authored a research article about our experience. This article has received more than 50 scholarly citations since then, demonstrating its impact on MOOC practice and research.
