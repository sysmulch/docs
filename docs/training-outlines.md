# Training Outlines

## Essentials of Scientific Writing for Publication

I will soon be teaching an 8-week course for engineering students at Kyushu University in Japan. The goal of the course is to give the students a broad understanding of scientific writing for publication so that they are prepared for graduate school.

## Research Writing Workshop for LIRA 2030 Researchers

In 2020, I designed and facilitated a 2-day writing workshop in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for African researchers funded by the International Science Council (ISC). The researchers were connected to ISC's *Leading Integrated Research for Agenda 2030 in Africa* program, and they were especially interested in identifying journals for their transdisciplinary work.
