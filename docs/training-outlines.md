## Essentials of Scientific Writing for Publication &mdash; Kyushu University Course

In 2025, I will be teaching an 8-week course for engineering students at Kyushu University in Japan. The goal of the course is to give the students a broad understanding of scientific writing for publication so that they are prepared for graduate school.

## Research Writing Workshop for LIRA 2030 Researchers &mdash; AuthorAID Event

In 2020, I facilitated a 2-day writing workshop in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for African researchers funded by the International Science Council (ISC). The researchers were connected to ISC's Leading Integrated Research for Agenda 2030 in Africa program, and they were especially interested in identifying journals for their transdisciplinary work.
