## The effects of plasma-processing conditions on the morphology of adherent human blood platelets

**Background:** When I was a graduate student of electrical engineering in the 2000s, I joined a plasma processing laboratory and worked on a project to explore how plasma polymerization can improve the blood compatibility of biomaterial surfaces. This work resulted in a publication in the *Journal of Applied Physics*, a leading journal in applied physics. I was the first author of this research article.

## A MOOC approach for training researchers in developing countries

**Background:** As a trainer with the AuthorAID project throughout the 2010s, I was in charge of an online course in scientific writing. I wrote the bulk of the content and used open source tools to develop the course. When demand for the course increased dramatically, my colleagues and I redesigned the course to be delivered in the format of a massive open online course (MOOC). The encouraging outcomes of the first two MOOCs motivated me to write up a research article about our innovative approach. This article, published in 2017, has received more than 50 scholarly citations, demonstrating its impact on MOOC practice and research.
