# The Other and the Pastoral Ideal: A Common Thread in *Ceremony* and *American Pastoral*

{: .fs-2 .fw-400 }
This essay is my original work from the course *The Modern American Novel: An Introduction*, offered by the University of Oxford’s Continuing Education Department in 2023. I wrote this essay in response to the following topic:

{: .fs-2 .fw-400 }
Discuss the ways in which either one, or any two, of the following four novels &mdash; *As I Lay Dying*, *Ceremony*, *Beloved* and *American Pastoral* &mdash; engage with ideas or ideologies about America and ‘Americanness’. In your answer make sure you write about the form and language of the novel(s) as well as about themes.

The pastoral ideal has a long history in literature, starting with Virgil’s poetry. It is noticeable in the early writings of Europeans who saw the American continent, and it is now considered to be a recurring theme in American literature.
In modern America, the pastoral ideal is a yearning for an intimate relationship with the natural world, which is to be achieved while maintaining one’s place in the modern world. It is a search for a kind of freedom in relation to wider modern society: to be within this society and to be free of it, as one pleases.

In Ceremony, Tayo, an Indian (Native American) man with mixed ancestry—half Laguna Pueblo and half white—returns to the Pueblo region after the Second World War. He is emotionally shattered. His immediate society consists of fellow Indian war veterans and family members. He is trapped in an insular world, following the habits and mores around him. Daily life is full of alcoholism and family anxieties, almost everyone living with the bitterness of having lost their lands to white people. The idealized harmony with nature is also lost, and there seems to be little hope of regaining it.
Tayo starts to seek something else: to redeem himself, to reconnect with his culture, but there is a resistance in him. This resistance arises from his individuality, which is an antithesis to the collective spirit of his Indian culture. As the narrative develops, Tayo aspires for something akin to the pastoral ideal: he embarks on a quest to find and retrieve a herd of somewhat wild cattle.

Turning to American Pastoral, the title of the book, the narrative, and the critical works about it make it clear that this book is a complex and layered exploration of the pastoral and the pastoral ideal in America. The main character, Seymour Levov, or the “Swede,” is an American Jew. His grandfather was a leather worker and couldn’t speak much English. His father and then the Swede have gone much farther. They have built up a successful business, becoming wealthier from one generation to the next, and becoming more American. The Swede with his sporting prowess and blond hair also has the physical attributes to pass as a member of the goyim—or more specifically, as a Wasp.

The Swede’s father, Lou Levov, has remained comfortable with his Jewish American identity and is perplexed with the hobbies of the American Gentiles: “What is it with them and fun?” [1] However, the Swede, who is described as “post-Jewish” by his brother, is not fulfilled living in the big, known city of Newark, where his leather goods business is based. He buys a spacious stone house in the countryside, in Old Rimrock in New Jersey, that he desired to own even as a teenager. His wife, a former Miss New Jersey, raises prize cattle in the vast grounds. 

The Swede has had an easy route to the pastoral ideal. Why does it start to unravel, and how can someone who is far more the other in American society—Tayo the Laguna Pueblo man—gain it and presumably hold onto it?

Tayo’s journey is different. To start with, the form of Ceremony is a nonlinear, prose–poetry narrative imbued with Indian myth and symbols. At the heart of this narrative is the Scalp Ceremony that Tayo undergoes, and which marks the start of his transformation. After the ceremony, Tayo, inspired by a dream, decides on his mission: he must retrieve the Mexican cattle that he and his uncle Josiah procured before he joined the war. The cattle are hardy and rangy. These native cattle will not obey easily, and therefore the task is going to be a challenge. What exactly is this task? Unlike the money-bought pastoral ideal of white America, his uncle Josiah sought a hard-won, natively won pastoral ideal: to contain the cattle in the commons of a vast landscape, to find pleasure in taming them to a certain degree, and to regenerate an old way of life removed from the modern wasteland that surrounds them. But the ideal slips away: Tayo joins the war, Josiah dies, and the cattle range away.

The pastoral must have a foil: a counterforce, something it is set off against. Otherwise, owning cattle, for example, would merely be an agricultural or rural enterprise. For the Indian, the foil is made up of the trials and ills of a version of modern America that is within the Indian reservation. A bleak place, this America, cut through with highways, is full of cheap bars, cheap prospects, and cheap lives. In this setting, the ancient Indian heritage is not easy to reckon with: living in brown skin, assailing one another with half-remembered stories of themselves and vitriolic views of the other, white America.

Tayo, struggling to emerge from this background, is the hero of the narrative, which is sympathetic to his endeavor. Soon after the Scalp Ceremony, he meets Ts’eh, an enigmatic Indian, and presents his mission: “I am looking for some cattle.” [2] Spending a night with her, he experiences a great calm and ease that can be interpreted as the inner aspect of the pastoral ideal. The outer aspect gradually comes closer: he locates his cattle and is eventually reunited with them. Soon, there is a bull in the picture, and there are calves: this is a pastoral in the making.

In American Pastoral as well, cattle are associated with the outer aspect of the pastoral ideal that the Swede and his wife Dawn have cultivated. Yet the form of this book is very different from Ceremony. The Swede’s life in the countryside, his stone house, his cattle—they are all part of a metafiction of the narrator, someone who does not tire of observing and imagining the lives, inclinations, and deviations of American Jews, of whom he himself is one.

One of these deviations, it seems, is an American Jew’s quest for the pastoral ideal. The Swede was born in Newark, a big city in New Jersey, and his family’s glove factory has long been based there. He had a privileged and successful life before he developed his Waspish pastoral ambition, which led him to Old Rimrock, a hundred acres of land, and the beef cattle that gave his wife purpose and made his landscape complete.

Cattle are invested with the procreative function to expand the pastoral, especially when the humans with the pastoral motive have limited or dwindling opportunities to procreate. Gazing at a perpetually healthy and fertile herd is a way to sustain the pastoral ideal even as one grows old, even as one’s children (if there were children) grow up and move away.
Tayo begins to experience the fulfillment of this gaze when he looks at his speckled cattle, the recently acquired yellow bull, and the new calves: “Tayo’s heart beat fast.” [3] The pernicious influences in his life disappear, and he becomes a respected member of his community. Ts’eh, deeply connected to the land, anchors him.

The Swede, on the other hand, nonchalantly achieves the cattle element of the pastoral through Dawn, and to him they are Dawn’s cattle. But later, near the end of the narrative, he begins to realize how much the prize bull Count meant to him. In a sense, Count represents the sturdy, unerring masculinity that the Swede thought was his forte as well. Count was at the core of the Swede’s pastoral: “A Bull Upon Which A Herd Can Be Built.” [4]

Tayo and the Swede are both swimming against the current to claim a pastoral that seems to be the prerogative of mainstream white America. Tayo reaches his pastoral after much struggle, and the reader can only guess if he will be able to hold onto it. Maybe, maybe not. The Swede did not have to struggle as much. And once he starts to lose his pastoral paradise, he feels it was held together tenuously all along. His father’s skepticism of his liberal and Gentile-like attitudes; his all-rejecting, bomb-making, fugitive daughter; his post-Catholic wife who has drifted away from him—his pastoral has been in decline for years. On the other hand, Bill Orcutt, his wife’s lover, is an exemplar of the full American whose family for generations has been ensconced in an unshakable American pastoral.

Can the other attain and sustain the pastoral ideal in America? Ceremony and American Pastoral suggest answers in different directions, but nonetheless it seems as though the desire for this ideal is quintessentially American.
