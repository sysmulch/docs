I have written and published practical guides to help researchers communicate their work.

### Ten Tips for Research Scholars Aiming for Their First Significant Publication

In 2023, after years of teaching scientific writing, I was inspired to write a practical guide to focus on a crucial stage of an aspiring researcher's journey: their first significant publication in a scholarly journal. As far as I know, there is no practical guide that looks at scientific writing from this particular angle. While developing the guide, I cited about 20 open access articles for readers to find further information. I published this guide in the journal Science Editor, which is widely read in the scientific publishing community in the United States and elsewhere.
