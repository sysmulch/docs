# Experimental Research
*A research article*
{: .fs-5 .fw-400 }

When I was a graduate student of engineering in Wisconsin, I joined a plasma physics laboratory to get a taste of experimental research. I got more than what I bargained for when I found myself in a publish-or-perish situation. After much struggle, including a period when I dropped out of graduate school, I managed to publish my thesis in a leading journal and thus obtain my M.S. degree. Through all the ups and downs of this journey, I realized that I enjoyed the process of scientific writing even if I wasn't inclined to continue along a scientific path. So I began to teach researchers how to write.
