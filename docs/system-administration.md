# Installing eScriptorium on a Cloud Server (2024)
*An installation guide*
{: .fs-5 .fw-400 }

My wife, who is a librarian, wanted to explore eScriptorium, an application for handwritten text recognition. I found various installation instructions, but none of them were aimed at the goal I had in mind: setting up an eScriptorium site on a small, cheap cloud server. I got in touch with one of the project developers, and with his help I managed to get the site online. In return, I wrote an installation guide and added it to one of the project wikis.

# Lessons Learned in Setting Up a Lean Institutional Repository (2021)
*A conference talk*
{: .fs-5 .fw-400 }

While living in Auroville, an international township in South India, I volunteered as a report writer and system administrator. I installed and maintained an institutional repository on a shoestring budget, and I gave a talk about my work at Open Repositories 2021.
