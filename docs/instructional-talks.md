# Instructional Talks

## Induction Video for Participants in Online Courses

INASP runs several online courses each year, reaching thousands of participants. In 2023, I created an induction video to help newly enrolled participants navigate through the learning platform and understand how their course is structured. I made annotated screenshots, wrote the script, and recorded the video with Dr. Zainab Yunusa-Kaltungo, a guest facilitator who is familiar with the course. After this video was introduced, requests for technical support from course participants reduced significantly.

## Making a Business Case for Documentation

I am a member of The Good Docs Project, a community of technical writers. In August 2024, I collaborated with two community members to give a talk to knowledge management professionals at the World Food Programme. The talk was about how to make a business case to improve documentation practices within an organization.
