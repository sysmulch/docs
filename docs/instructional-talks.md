## Making a Busines Case for Documentation

I am a member of The Good Docs Project, a community of technical writers. In August 2024, I collaborated with two community members to give a talk to knowledge management professionals at the World Food Prgramme. The talk was about how to make a business case to improve documentation practices within an organization.

##  Onboarding Video for Participants in INASP's Online Courses

INASP runs several online courses each year, reaching thousands of participants. In 2023, I produced an onboarding video for these participants to help them navigate through the learning platform and understand how their course is structured. After this video was introduced, requests for technical support from course participants reduced significantly.
