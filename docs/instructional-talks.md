## Making a business case for documentation

I am a member of The Good Docs Project, a community of technical writers. In August 2024, I collaborated with two community members to give a talk to knowledge management professionals at the World Food Programme. The talk was about how to make a business case to improve documentation practices within an organization.

##  Onboarding video for participants in online courses

My organization runs several online courses each year, reaching thousands of participants. In 2023, I produced an onboarding video for these participants. I first made a PowerPoint file with annotated screenshots and wrote a script for the two speakers (an AuthorAID guest facilitator and me). After this video was introduced in INASPâ€™s online courses, requests for technical support from participants reduced significantly.
