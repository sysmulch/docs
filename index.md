Working for an international development organization, I've facilitated workshops for academics in many countries and played a central role in an online learning initiative.

Check out my work samples on this site, organized into domains. And here's [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ravimurugesan/).

I expect to become a U.S. permanent resident in September 2024, and I will be living in Princeton, New Jersey.
