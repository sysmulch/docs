I've taught scientific writing in many countries, and I've developed online courses for a global audience. With an academic background in engineering, I also have strong technical skills.

I expect to become a U.S. permanent resident in September 2024, and I am open to contract opportunities. Check out my work samples on this site. And here's [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ravimurugesan/).
