# Hello there!

My name is Ravi Murugesan, and I am a technical communicator.

I've led writing workshops for researchers in many countries, and I've developed online courses for a global audience. With my background in engineering, I'm a bit of a nerd as well.

I expect to become a U.S. permanent resident in September 2024, and I am open to contract opportunities. Check out my work samples on this site. And here's [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ravimurugesan/).
