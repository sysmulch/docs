# Hello there!

My name is Ravi Murugesan, and this site is my technical writing portfolio.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

<img style="float: right; max-width: 30%;" src="images/Photograph.jpg">

I am transitioning to technical writing after wearing many hats, most recently as an instructional writer, e-learning developer, and amateur sysadmin.

I bring
- diverse writing experience
- empathy for readers
- good questioning and listening skills
- a strong collaborative spirit

[Here is my one-page resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yV_huFjidGQ5e0fNRyvjjBvORnoC409QvgL87Js_QUM/edit?usp=sharing).
